## Overview

<a href="#">Banktivity for macOS</a> is designed for people who want to treat their finances as a project, not just a collection of balances. It aggregates accounts from banks, credit cards and investment platforms into a single interface, giving a clear view of net worth and cash flow. Transactions can be categorised and tagged to reflect how money is actually used, supporting budgets that match real life rather than abstract categories. For users working toward savings or debt-free goals, this visibility is critical.

The app supports multiple budgeting approaches, from envelopes to scheduled spending plans. Reports and <a href="#">trend charts</a> help identify patterns, such as subscriptions that have faded into the background or categories that consistently exceed expectations. Investment views provide insight into holdings and performance, situating long-term assets alongside day-to-day spending. Import tools and reconciliation workflows ensure that what appears in Banktivity matches statements, reducing bookkeeping uncertainty.

On macOS, Banktivity feels like a dedicated personal finance console. It can be reviewed weekly or monthly to adjust plans and confirm progress, or left open as a live dashboard while working on related paperwork. Over time, its ledgers become a financial history you can actually learn from, rather than a pile of disconnected statements.
